# AUTOTRAINER
An Automatic DNN TrainingProblem Detection and Repair System


## How effective is AUTOTRAINER in detecting and fixing training problems?
As we shown in our paper, AUTOTRAINER can detect all five kinds of training problems in the input model and

## How efficient is AUTOTRAINER in detecting and fixing training problems?


## How to use AUTOTRAINER?
Here we prepare two simple cases in xx which is based on the Cirlce and Blob dataset on Sklearn. You can just enter the corresponding folder and run `demo.py` directly to see how AUTOTRANING solve the problems in these case. 
```
cd xxxx
python demo.py
```

If you want to try on your own dataset, you should rewrite the `demo.py` and add your dateset in it. Additionally, you should write your training configuration in a '.pkl' file. This file should include the dataset, batch size in training, the details of the optimizer, the loss function and the max training epoch.

## How can I set the configurable parameters?
