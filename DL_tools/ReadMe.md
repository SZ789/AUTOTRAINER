## TART
Training Automatic Repair Tool: 
Focused on **5** kinds of training problems(i.e., Dying ReLU, Vanishing Gradient, Exploding Gradient, Training Unstable, Training Not Converge) in DNN.

### Code:
The code to reproduce the simple cases of the 5 kinds problem on DNN/CNN/RNN/LSTM(Need to change the path to save the model, also need to run the code in the corresponding dir.).

### Data & Utils:
Contains the modularized code of our tool. The detection module will be completed soon, and an automatic repair module will be added in the future.
Data contains modularized code of the dataset.

### models:
The path I saved the reproduced models. 

### log:
The training los(csv files) and the loss/acc curve will be saved here.
